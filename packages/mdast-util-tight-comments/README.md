# mdast-util-tight-comments

This is a small [mdast][1] utility that extends [mdast-util-to-markdown][2]
allowing for the selective removal of newlines around certain mdast comment
nodes.

This is a low level project used by [remark-tight-comments][3], which is a
companion package to [remark-ignore][4].

## Install

> Due to the nature of the unified ecosystem, this package is ESM only and
> cannot be `require`'d.

```bash
npm install mdast-util-tight-comments
```

## Usage

Suppose we have the following Markdown file `example.md`:

```markdown
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- remark-ignore-start -->
<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->

- [Install remark](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Related](#related)
- [Contributing and Support](#contributing-and-support)
  - [Contributors](#contributors)

<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- remark-ignore-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<!-- Begin the documentation section -->

<!-- TODO: add another section here -->

<!-- remark-ignore -->

# Install [remark](https://npm.im/remark)
```

Notice how the `<!-- START doctoc‚Ä¶` and `<!-- DON'T EDIT‚Ä¶` comments are
_tightly_ positioned such that there is no newline between them. This is
required by [doctoc][5].

Now, running the following JavaScript:

```typescript
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import { toMarkdown } from 'mdast-util-to-markdown';

const doc = fs.readFileSync('example.md');
const tree = unified().use(remarkParse).parse(doc);

console.log(toMarkdown(tree));
```

Would output the following (assuming remark is [configured][6] for dash bullets
and singular list item indents):

```markdown
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<!-- remark-ignore-start -->

<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->

<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->

- [Install remark](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Related](#related)
- [Contributing and Support](#contributing-and-support)
  - [Contributors](#contributors)

<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->

<!-- remark-ignore-end -->

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<!-- Begin the documentation section -->

<!-- TODO: add another section here -->

<!-- remark-ignore -->

# Install [remark](https://npm.im/remark)
```

Notice how the `<!-- START doctoc‚Ä¶` and `<!-- DON'T EDIT‚Ä¶` comments are now
separated by a newline, which will cause erroneous behavior when running doctoc.
~~Additionally, all the unnecessary newlines around the comments are very
ugly.~~

Suppose instead we ran the following JavaScript:

```typescript
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import { toMarkdown } from 'mdast-util-to-markdown';
import { joinTightComments } from 'mdast-util-tight-comments';

const doc = fs.readFileSync('example.md');
const tree = unified().use(remarkParse).parse(doc);

console.log(toMarkdown(tree, { join: [joinTightComments] }));
```

Then we would get the following output:

```markdown
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- remark-ignore-start -->
<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->

- [Install](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Related](#related)
- [Contributing and Support](#contributing-and-support)
  - [Contributors](#contributors)

<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- remark-ignore-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<!-- Begin the documentation section -->
<!-- TODO: add another section here -->

<!-- remark-ignore -->

# Install [remark](https://npm.im/remark)
```

That's better! But not perfect. What if we want to preserve the default spacing
around the `<!-- Begin the‚Ä¶` comment? Specifically, we want to maintain the
newline _before_ and _after_ this comment.

To preserve newlines before a comment, affix the opening tag with a `|`. To
preserve newlines after a comment, prefix the closing tag with a `|`. These can
be combined to preserve a newline both before and after a comment.

For example, suppose we edited `example.md` to contain the following:

```markdown
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- remark-ignore-start -->
<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->

- [Install remark](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [API](#api)
- [Related](#related)
- [Contributing and Support](#contributing-and-support)
  - [Contributors](#contributors)

<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->
<!-- remark-ignore-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<!--| Begin the documentation section |-->

<!-- TODO: add another section here -->

<!-- remark-ignore -->

# Install [remark](https://npm.im/remark)
```

Notice the `<!--| Begin the documentation section |-->` line. Since there aren't
any other remark plugins being used, running the above JavaScript with this new
`readme.md` file would output the contents of the file unchanged.

Also notice the `<!-- remark-ignore -->` line. This specific comment receives
special consideration in that:

1. There will never be a newline between it and the next node.
2. There will always be a newline between it and the previous node.

> If you're running prettier _after_ remark, you must surround the comments
> around which you want to preserve tightened spacing with
> `<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->` and `<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->`.
